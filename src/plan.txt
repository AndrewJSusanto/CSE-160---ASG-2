Finished:
    Draw a cube
    Function that can draw a cube using a given matrix.
        ie. drawCube( Matrix M );
    Model rotating on a global axis when using a slider (passed explicitly
        as a uGlobalRotation uniform variable to the vertex shader)
    Single renderScene() function that handles all drawing
    Complete animal with at least 8 parts
    At least one joint angle is controllable with sliders
    A tick() function works and animates at least one part
    Buttons to turn animation on and off
    Color on most of the body in a way that looks nice
    Animation on most of the animal and it moves in a natural way

    Third level joint
    Perf. optimization / indicator

To-do:
    1. Mouse control to rotate
        We know how to track mouse movement, mouse down/up/move
        Generate events when user interacts with the canvas
        On mouse down, detect mouse move
        From mouse move, change rotation using trajectory of mouse movement
        On mouse release, end event
        I have mouse control on rotation revolving around the y axis
    2. Dedicated tick() function
        Have, connected with renderScene() for drawing
    3. Poke with shift-click for a different animation
    
    4. Non-cube primitive
    5. Perf. optimization
